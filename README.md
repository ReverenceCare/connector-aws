# AWS Connector

![Tests](https://github.com/sartography/spiffworkflow-connector-aws/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)

When a Connector like this one is imported into a project with the spiffworkflow-proxy blueprint, it will allow Service Tasks to make calls to AWS systems -- such as working with S3 or Dynamodb.

Please see [SpiffWorkflow Proxy](https://github.com/sartography/spiffworkflow-proxy) for more information.
